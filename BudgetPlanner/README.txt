Budget Planner
==============

The BudgetPlanner is a WPF application with a C# backend created in Visual Studio 2010.

Within BudgetPlanner, you can enter an estimated range for incomes and multiple different
	expense categories, within which you may then vary the amounts of each category for different scenarios.
Taxes are calculated automatically based on approximations of the current US tax code. No deductions,
	exemptions, or boundary cases are used, but it will be generally accurate. State and local
	income taxes are also approximated.
Reports are generated live in a viewing frame in the main window (monthly or annual), and can be
	saved on command to an external file of the user's choosing.

This application came about as I began looking at various career paths and their corresponding locations
	and costs of living. I created the BudgetPlanner to easily facilitate multiple scenarios
	within different potential financial settings. It also allows for a second income to be taken
	into account for users who are/will be in a cooperative relationship.
